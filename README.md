# About
Get Jiggy with It ~ Na-na-na-na-na-na!

Make a dynamic web page that populates with dancing-themed gifs of your choice. You can add as many as you want, as there was a for-loop code that appends a button for each string in the array. 

GIPHY API was called with JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site. GIPHY API was accessed by obtaining an API key.
